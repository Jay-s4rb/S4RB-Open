# Hi!
I know that it's a bit rough around the edges (half of the code is date manipulation, I wanted to try it without a library ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯) and that there are no test, but unfortunately I've not managed to spend as much time as I wanted on this due to university work. That said, I think it meets the base requirements and if you revisit in a couple days I'll try to update it in the meantime, this is my first time ever working with Angular5 and I don't have much experience writing tests so I'm sure there is room for improvement here even if it will take me a bit longer.

# How to run it
  * install [angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md#installation)
  * `npm install -g json-server`
  * json-server --watch db.json
  * `cd s4rb-ui`
    * `ng serve --open`
  * cd `s4rb-api`
    * `node app.js` or `npm start`
